To execute this project, we need to erun flow.cpp

All the video clips are stored under directory named 'Clips/'.
When we execute flow.cpp, avi player with tracker will be prmpted. User can select in frame by clicking on track bar.
These frames will be stored under 'W_group'.

Flow.cpp will take images one by one and find region of interest to capture just the traffic sign from the image.

Following are the subtasks:

1) Video Capture - Pranav
2) 2D Convolution - Kathan
3) Histogram Equalization - Not Done
4) Edge Detection - Kathan
5) Binarization - Kathan
6) Feature Vector Computation - Pranav
7) Form Feature Vector - Pranav
8) Eigen Value/ Eigen Vector - Kathan
9) K Means Clustering - Pranav
10) Estimate P - Chirag
11) Decision Making Function - Chirag 

Functions are written in flow.cpp
